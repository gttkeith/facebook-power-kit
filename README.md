# fb-powerkit
A quick and dirty set of tools for Facebook power users and page admins

Dependencies:  
* Python 2.7 https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
* Python for Facebook https://github.com/pythonforfacebook/facebook-sdk
* Facebook Graph API access token https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/ (remember to enable the relevant permissions!)

The scripts include hidden comments when doing their batch actions.

User files are stored at ~/Documents/fb-powerkit, and outputs are exported to ~/Downloads. Go crazy!
